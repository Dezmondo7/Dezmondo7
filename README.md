# Hi, I'm Dale 👋
## 🛡️ Cyber Security Student / Researcher & Technical Explorer
I am transitioning from a Cyber Consultancy background into a deeply technical role within the security ecosystem, leveraging a background in full-stack builds and structured computer science coursework to understand how modern applications and infrastructure are secured. 

# 🛠️ Technical Toolkit
### 🔍 SIEM & Monitoring
Wazuh (XDR/SIEM): Log analysis, endpoint detection, and real-time telemetry monitoring.
Telemetry Data: Experience in building custom data pipelines to visualize user behavior.

### ⚔️ Offensive Security
Ethical Hacking: Vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.
TryHackMe: Active practitioner with a focus on network exploitation and privilege escalation.

### 🌐 Networking & Cloud
Infrastructure: VMWare Workstation; architecting and managing isolated attack/defense environments.
Core Networking: TCP/IP, DNS, Firewall ruleset configuration, and Routing.
Cloud Security: Microsoft Azure security fundamentals (aligned with SC-900) and Identity & Access Management (IAM).

### 💻 Infrastructure & Scripting
OS Mastery: Linux (Ubuntu/Kali) and Windows (Server 2022/Desktop).
Scripting: Linux Bash (automation/permissions), Windows PowerShell, and Python for security automation.

### 🏗️ Full-Stack Engineering
Frontend/Backend: React, Next.js, Node.js, ExpressJS.
Databases: PostgreSQL, SQL, and Supabase.
Workflows: Git & GitHub (CI/CD workflows and technical documentation).
