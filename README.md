# Hi, I'm Dale 👋
## 🛡️ Cyber Security Student / Researcher & Technical Explorer
I am transitioning from a Cyber Consultancy background into a deeply technical role within the security ecosystem, leveraging a background in full-stack builds and structured computer science coursework to understand how modern applications and infrastructure are secured. 

## 📈 My Evolution
2022: Began my journey into development, focusing on fundamental logic and basic Python/JS scripting. 

2024: Transitioned into Full-Stack development, exploring React architectures and database management.

2025/26: Specialized in Defensive Security Operations, focusing on architectural hardening, credential lifecycle management, and secure API integration.

## 🛠️ Technical Toolkit
### 🔍 SIEM & Monitoring
Wazuh (XDR/SIEM): Log analysis, endpoint detection, and real-time telemetry monitoring.
Telemetry Data: Experience in building custom data pipelines to visualize user behavior.

### ⚔️ Offensive Security
Ethical Hacking: Vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.
TryHackMe: Active practitioner with a focus on network exploitation and privilege escalation.

### 🌐 Networking & Cloud
Infrastructure: VMWare Workstation; architecting and managing isolated attack/defense environments.
Core Networking: TCP/IP, DNS, Firewall ruleset configuration, and Routing.
Cloud Security: Microsoft Azure security fundamentals (aligned with SC-900) and Identity & Access Management (IAM).

### 💻 Infrastructure & Scripting
OS Mastery: Linux (Ubuntu/Kali) and Windows (Server 2022/Desktop).
Scripting: Linux Bash (automation/permissions), Windows PowerShell, and Python for security automation

### 🚀 Technical Milestones (Security & Infrastructure)
Active Directory Attack & Defense Lab
Focus: Network Security, Identity Management, and Penetration Testing.
Key Tech: Windows Server 2022, VMWare, Kali Linux, Nmap.
Highlight: Successfully documented a full domain compromise, from reconnaissance to SMB Null Session exploitation.

### 🏗️ Full-Stack Engineering
Frontend/Backend: React, Next.js, Node.js, ExpressJS.
Databases: PostgreSQL, SQL, and Supabase.
Workflows: Git & GitHub (CI/CD workflows and technical documentation).

### 🚀 KreativeWeb3d: Secure AI Integration
Focus: Secure API Implementation & Asynchronous Data Pipelines.
Key Tech: React, GPT-4, Supabase (PostgreSQL).
Highlight: Engineered a secure "handshake" between a frontend interface and the OpenAI API, managing telemetry data and user session privacy.

###  🚀 Secure Cloud-to-Frontend Data Pipeline
The Goal: To architect a resilient and secure database middleman for real-time data handling.
The Build: Deployed a Supabase (PostgreSQL) backend that acts as a secure bridge between a remote cloud server and a React-based frontend.
Research Focus: Focused on end-to-end encryption and the implementation of Row Level Security (RLS) policies with the use of a cloud server to ensure that even if an API key is intercepted, the data remains scoped and protected.

### 🚀 Next.js Analytics Dashboard
Focus: Behavioral Telemetry & Administrative Visibility.
Highlight: Developed a custom heatmap engine to visualize user interactions, demonstrating an understanding of data ingestion and secure persistence.

### 🎓 Academic Projects (edX Coursework)
#### Movie Recommender System
Focus: Algorithms & Data Handling.
Key Tech: React / JavaScript.
Highlight: Implemented logic to process large datasets and return filtered results based on user input, a core concept in Data Integrity and Filtering.

#### Curated / Curated-Public
Focus: Frontend Architecture & Content Management.
Key Tech: JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3.
Highlight: Developed a polished UI for content curation, focusing on DOM manipulation and efficient state management.
